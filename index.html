    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
      Located at Argentina, Wine Cellars finds itself in a magic place. Here the grape receives permanent sunlight, soft and dry wind and abundant water that comes down from mountains and combines with the stony ground achieving high quality wines, fruity and round.
      Modern and innovative, the current winery was built under high quality standards protecting and respecting the historic heritage of the area. Each detail was carefully calculated as well as the original vegetation and the construction was built under non-seismic techniques among the most advanced ones in the whole world.

      <h2 class="title-box">WINE HISTORY IN ARGENTINA</h2>
      <p>
        Wine is a traditional element of Argentine gastronomy, followed by ingredients such as olive oil, lemon, garlic, onion and bay leaf, all typical of the Mediterranean diet. It would be difficult to imagine an Argentine dinner or lunch, especially the typical Argentine asado, without wine.
        Strictly speaking, until the great transatlantic immigration from Italy, Spain, Occitania and even Greece began in the second half of the 19th century, the taste of the Argentine urban Creole population was centered on red table wines, such as those of Priorat origin, while the rural and semi-rural gaucho population drank certain types of fermented grape syrup, and on certain occasions real grape ales. In the artisanal production of Argentine wine, the so-called "vino patero" was outstanding (and deservedly so). Almost all these wines, in terms of their fermentation content and color, fall into the broad classification of red wines.
        Due to their roots in predominantly European cultures, Argentines are good wine consumers: in 2006, consumption was 45 liters per capita per year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most traditional wine among Argentines is red wine, full-bodied and very astringent. Because of its color it is colloquially called quebracho, in allusion to the Schinopsis balansae, a southern tree with reddish wood and, like red wines, rich in tannins. In the second half of the 20th century, the middle classes of the country favored the so-called "rosé wines", with a bouquet intermediate between the intense and harsh red wines (popularly called "totíns" or "tintardos" by the porteños) and the softer "claretes" of the Italian type, or even the very soft white wines (although sometimes with high alcohol content). Likewise, in a similar period, common white wines became generalized among the population; such generalization entailed a negligent elaboration, from which the excellent and original torrontés wines, of honeyed color, pleasant and fruity taste, excellent aroma and strong alcoholic content, were spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wine production in Argentina dates back to 1551, when the presbyter Juan Cedrón (or perhaps Cidrón) planted in Santiago del Estero (province), the first muscatel and "country grape" vines, coming from Spain and in turn brought from the city of La Serena, Chile. The purpose of the clergyman was to use the product in the Catholic ritual of the mass. Approximately half a century later, the Franciscans imported malvasia grapes from the Canary Islands to Salta, the purpose of these missionaries was to obtain a white and smooth wine, also suitable for this ritual. Thus, varieties of mistela were obtained from grapes such as vitis rupestris and vitis labrusca, or from the so-called "chinches grapes," which give rise to wines with a harsh and acid taste. The Jesuits and Franciscans were also responsible for the early importation of excellent strains of Vitis vinifera. At the end of the 16th century the religious orders introduced vines along the Río de la Plata, and today the interfluvial zone of Concordia is an important production center.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last decade, Argentine wine has achieved well-deserved prestige in the world market. This is due both to the efforts of local wineries and to the care and guidance of renowned winemakers such as, for example, Alberto Antonini, a great promoter of the robust and exquisite Malbecs from the Southern Cone.
        With the exception of the wines from the Coast and the Sierras de Córdoba, practically all of Argentina's vineyards are grown in irrigated oases. These take advantage of the fresh water produced by the thawing of the high mountains. Such water is pressurized from the rivers and carried by irrigation canals or aqueducts to the vineyards.

        <li>Red wines are made from black grapes fermented with the grape skins (which is where the red colour of the wine comes from), seeds, and stems. Red wine is high in tannins, which causes that bitter, dry taste in your mouth after you take a sip.</li>
        <li><b><u>Starter Picks</u></b>: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Chianti, Beaujolais</li>
        <li><b><u>Food Pairings</u></b>: Pair red wine with hearty dishes containing red meat, such as BBQ ribs, burgers and steak, pasta, and pizza.</li>
        <li><b><u>Good to Know</u></b>: The darker or newer the wine, the more tannins it has. Go for an older wine, which will taste less dry and bitter. </li>

        <li>White wines are made from both white grapes and black grapes. But while red wines are fermented with grape skins, white wines are not. Instead, the skins are separated so only the clear grape juice is used. White wine has few tannins; its acidic nature is what outlines its fresh, crisp and tart flavours.</li>
        <li><b><u>Picks</u></b>: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling</li>
        <li><b><u>Pairings</u></b>: White wine goes best with lighter dishes, such as poultry, fish and other seafood, curries, tacos, cheese, salad, popcorn, and chips</li>
        <li><b><u>Pro Tip</u></b>: Chill white wine before drinking to bring out its flavours.</li>

        <li>Sparkling wines are carbonated wines, hence the nickname “bubbly.” Sparkling wines are made from black and white grapes, and carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring byproduct of fermentation. The most well-known sparkling wine is champagne, which is often used in celebrations like New Year’s and weddings.</li>

        <li><b><u>Food Pairings</u></b>: Light foods, such as soft cheeses, seafood, including smoked salmon and shrimp, salad, fresh fruit, and popcorn.</li>
        <li><b><u>Good to Know</u></b>: Sparkling wines are named for the region where they are produced, such as the province of Champagne in France.</li>
